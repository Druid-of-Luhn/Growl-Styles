# Growl-Styles

#### A compilation of styles for the [Growl App](http://growl.info)

This repository is made for _your_ Growl styles. Just push a style you
created _yourself_, and unless really awful, it should be included soon after.

## About

This repository contains styles created for the Growl application. Styles can
easily be created by taking their example style (on their website) and editing
it to your liking with CSS.

All styles created by those with their credits next to the name of the file.
Those styles not included in the folder are linked to, leading to their official
page, as they are ones that I like but do not have the rights to.

### Mountain Lion – by Billy Brown

This is a style I created that replicates the OS X Mountain Lion notification
design. It is completely built from scratch by myself.

### Windows 8

These styles are created to replicate the Windows 8 notification popups, albeit
with a little more style to make them look nicer. They are also built from
scratch by myself.

scratch).
