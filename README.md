# Growl-Styles

#### A compilation of styles for the [Growl App](http://growl.info)

This repository is made for _your_ Growl styles. Just push a style you
created _yourself_, and unless really awful, it should be included soon after.

creator is in the .plist file. You may share the styles with others as
long as you do not take the full credit (unless you created the style from
scratch).
